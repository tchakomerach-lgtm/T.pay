# T.Pay Engineering Operating System

## Mission
Construire T.Pay de façon incrémentale, testable, sécurisée et exploitable sur le terrain. Ce fichier est la mémoire technique persistante du projet.

## Agent team
- architect: architecture, ADR, boundaries
- security: threat modeling, authz, secrets, abuse resistance
- finance: ledger, wallet, payments, credit, commissions, subsidies
- domain: organisation, microfinance, education, marketplace, social, opportunity
- ai: AI Core, tool permissions, evaluation, guardrails
- frontend: UX/UI, accessibility, offline-first, motion
- qa: unit/integration/e2e/property/contract tests
- sre: observability, reliability, backups, incident response
- cost: token/compute/database/API cost optimization

Each agent must touch only its domain, document cross-domain changes, and never bypass security or ledger invariants.

## Construction loop
Every brick MUST execute and respect docs/skills/TPAY-CONSTRUCTION-001.md:

DISCOVER -> BIBLE-MAP -> CURRENT-CODE -> EXTERNAL-RESEARCH -> THREAT-GATE -> DESIGN -> IMPLEMENT -> TEST -> SECURITY REVIEW -> OBSERVE -> COST REVIEW -> CI -> RECORD.

The loop is iterative. A failed test, security gate, CI check, material Bible change, provider-contract change or unresolved high-risk exception sends the brick back to the appropriate earlier stage.

Before every brick, consult docs/bibles/TPAY-BIBLE-CONSULTATION-REGISTRY.md and the mandatory domain Bibles/skills mapped there. Do not rely on memory when the repository contains the authoritative rule.

External research is evidence-driven, not decorative. Use primary standards and authoritative documentation when a design decision depends on current security, protocol, regulatory, infrastructure or interoperability guidance. Record only the decision-relevant findings, not private chain-of-thought.

## Coding rules
- Strict TypeScript.
- No floating-point arithmetic for money.
- Idempotency for commands with side effects.
- Append-only financial ledger.
- Server-side authorization.
- Organization context required for organization resources.
- Secrets only through secret stores/environment.
- Redact sensitive data from logs.
- External providers behind adapters.
- AI tools are deny-by-default and policy-controlled.
- Prefer boring, auditable primitives over clever abstractions.

## Free/low-token execution
1. Read repository state before reasoning about implementation.
2. Consult the Bible registry and only the relevant Bibles/skills.
3. Search existing code/docs before creating anything.
4. Batch independent reads/searches.
5. Use small deterministic patches.
6. Reuse shared types and helpers.
7. Avoid regenerating large files.
8. Run targeted tests first, full suite after a coherent batch.
9. Summarize state in AGENTS.md/decision records rather than repeating context.
10. Use local/static validation before expensive external calls.
11. Do not repeatedly reread unchanged Bibles; retain their source/commit reference in the construction record.
12. Never spend tokens explaining work that can be encoded as tests/docs.

## Security baseline
OWASP ASVS 5.0 is the stable application-security baseline. NIST SSDF is used as a secure-development lifecycle reference. WebAuthn Level 3 is a current W3C Recommendation. OpenTelemetry semantic conventions are mandatory for telemetry naming. Recheck release-critical external standards when the relevant source/version changes.

## Current construction state
Foundation is implemented for domain types, security sessions/policies, risk controls, audit/telemetry, ledger invariants, wallet/payment/commission primitives, identity/passkey contracts, organization creation, KYC contracts and ledger idempotency. S-02 durable settlement is merged. S-02.5 adds the concrete PostgreSQL transaction adapter and transactional settlement schema. S-02.5.1 adds the live PostgreSQL integration test and migration runner. S-03.1 adds the provider-neutral adapter registry, normalized provider contract, TMoney/Flooz/microfinance contract adapters, bounded retry and circuit-breaker primitives. S-03.2 adds strict signed callback parsing, exact raw-body HMAC verification, freshness and atomic replay-claim contracts. Live provider credentials/network clients remain intentionally disconnected until provider-specific schemas, durable replay persistence and settlement integration gates pass.

Community Tontine remains an independent interoperable domain: daily/weekly/monthly cycles, fixed/variable/goal contributions, membership/roles, beneficiary rotation, governance, partner microfinance selection, multi-channel collection, provider reconciliation, KYC/human payout gates, field continuity and idempotent contribution intents. It never creates a second ledger; T.Pay Financial Core remains authoritative.

## Definition of Done
Code + tests + security controls + observability + documentation + migration/rollback plan when stateful + CI green.

## Settlement Orchestrator state
The settlement construction gate is explicit: contribution idempotency → payment intent → provider adapter → signed callback → freshness/anti-replay → provider validation → atomic financial settlement → versioned fee snapshot → contribution confirmation → receipt/e-carnet → post-commit event/notification → reconciliation. S-02 defines the durable transaction contract; S-02.5 implements the PostgreSQL transaction lifecycle and schema; S-02.5.1 verifies it against live PostgreSQL; S-03.1 establishes the provider boundary; S-03.2 establishes callback authenticity/freshness/replay contracts. Next gate: provider-specific callback schemas plus durable replay claim integration.
